Hello Git and GitHub

this is a new line added to the readme.txt file

yet another new line yes!

now there should be something appearing when running the command "git diff"

testing again withouth filename in command line

yes you dont need the filename in the command line

hmmm... when we ran push we did not get all lines...

ahaa... it's ME not YOU (again) - forgot to save the docuent (facepalm)! :D

testing to push once more...

interesting... so you can have a file that has been changed, and when you 'git push' it does not get uploaded to remote repo... why?
